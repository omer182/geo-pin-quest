## Current State

The application is now back to using:
- **Google Maps API** for map rendering
- **Styled maps** with labels removed for geography challenge
- **Click-based pin placement** instead of 3D raycasting
- **Level-based progression system** (maintained)
- **250+ city database** (maintained)
- **Scoring system** (0-1000 points, maintained)

## Requirements

- Google Maps API key must be set in `.env` as `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Google Maps JavaScript API must be enabled in Google Cloud Console

## Next Steps

The application is ready for use with Google Maps. You can:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test the geography game functionality
3. Deploy to production when ready

All Globe-related code has been completely removed and the application is back to its stable Google Maps implementation.
